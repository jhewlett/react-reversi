react-reversi
=============

Implementation of the game of Reversi (Othello) in React.js.

I mostly use this as a playground for trying out the latest libs and techniques.

Right now it's using [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux) for data flow, inline styles, and [stateless function components](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/09/10/react-v0.14-rc1.html#stateless-function-components) from React v0.14 RC1.
